# Modeling-Earthquake-Damage
This is a group project based on the dataset from https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/ and comprised of a group of four members (Guan Yu, Zhen Ling, Kelvin and Phil). The following are the problem statement and description for our project. We decided to use decision tree method as the mechanism to predict the level of earthquake damage, given certain environmental and infrastructure variables. This is a project undertaken for one of the course requirement during the undergraduate syllabus at NTU school of MAE.

# Problem Statement:
What characteristics do earthquake-resistant buildings have?/ How to minimise damage during an earthquake?

# Brief description: 
Earthquakes are natural disasters that we are unable to avoid and it is bound to cause various economical damage to the country. Hence, by studying the dataset collected by Nepal's Central Bureau of Statistics after Nepal was struck with a devastating earthquake, we hope to identify characteristics/elements (materials and foundations, etc) of earthquake-resilient buildings which can be incorporated into future building constructions to prevent further incidents. Models will be created to predict the extent of damage building of certain characteristics is likely to suffer during an earthquake. Identify characteristics/elements (materials and foundations, etc) of earthquake-resilient buildings which can be incorporated into future building constructions to prevent further incidents.
